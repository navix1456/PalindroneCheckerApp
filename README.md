# Palindrome Checker App

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of the Palindrome Checker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and Git workflow practices.

## 🚀 Use Case 1: Application Entry & Welcome Message

### 🎯 Goal
To establish the application startup flow by displaying a welcome message and system details when the program begins execution.

---

## 🔄 Application Flow

1. Program starts.
2. JVM invokes the `main()` method.
3. Application name is displayed.
4. Application version is displayed.
5. System initialization message is shown.
6. Program prepares to proceed to the next use case.

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- **Class** – Container for application logic.
- **Main Method** – Entry point of the Java application.
- **Static Keyword** – Allows JVM to execute `main()` without object creation.
- **Console Output** – `System.out.println()` for displaying messages.
- **Application Flow Control** – Defines startup behavior.

## 💻 Sample Output

Welcome to the Palindrome Checker Management System
Version : 1.0
System initialized successfully.

# 🚀 Use Case 2: Hardcoded Palindrome Validation

## 🎯 Goal
Check whether a predefined (hardcoded) string is a palindrome and display the result.

## 🔄 Flow
1. Program starts.
2. A hardcoded string is stored.
3. Characters are compared from both ends.
4. Loop runs till half of the string length.
5. Result is printed.
6. Program exits.

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- String
- String Literal
- for Loop
- charAt() method
- if-else Condition
- Boolean flag
- Console Output
